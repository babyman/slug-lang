##  _"Perfect is the enemy of good."_

```
Slug will never end,
but still I write and mend.
Perfect waits and fades —
good enough, again.

Slug is a work in progress, and may never reach a stable release. However I am using it for all of my personal projects
in an effort to keep it alive and useful.
