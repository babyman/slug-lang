# Welcome to Slug: An Intro Course for Developers

Hi! In this course-style guide, I am going to walk you through Slug step by step, just like a hands-on bootcamp. You
will start with a tiny program, then build confidence through short lessons, and finish with mini projects and tests.

By the end, you will be able to:

- Read and write idiomatic Slug.
- Build small scripts and data pipelines.
- Use functions, pattern matching, and collections effectively.
- Test your code and reason about concurrency.

## How this guide works

Each module includes:

- A quick concept intro.
- Short examples you can run.
- A tiny challenge to lock it in.

Keep a terminal open and run the samples as you go. You will learn fastest by typing the code yourself.
