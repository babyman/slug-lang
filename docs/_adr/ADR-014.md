title: ADR-014 Raw Strings using Single Quotes
date: 2026-01-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The language currently supports interpreted strings using double quotes (`"..."` and `"""..."""`), which process escape
sequences (like `\n`) and string interpolation (via `{{...}}`).

There is a need for "raw" strings where backslashes and other characters are treated literally. This is particularly
useful for:

1. **Regular Expressions and Paths**: Avoiding "backslash-itis".
2. **Template Definitions**: The language intends to support Mustache as a template library. Since Mustache uses `{{ }}`
   as its own delimiters, defining a Mustache template within an interpreted string would require excessive escaping of
   the host language's interpolation markers.

## Decision

We will implement raw strings using single quotes (`'`) to provide a clear distinction from interpreted double-quote
strings.

### Strictly Literal (WYSIWYG)

Raw strings will follow a strictly literal model. No characters are processed as escape sequences or interpolation
markers.

- `'C:\Users\Name'` results in the literal backslashes being preserved.
- `'{{variable}}'` results in a literal string, allowing Mustache templates to be defined without escaping.

### Single and Multi-line Support

- **Single-line raw strings**: Delimited by `'... '`.
- **Multi-line raw strings**: Delimited by `'''...'''`.

### Delimiter Collision Handling

To include a single quote within a raw string, the user must use the multi-line variant (triple single quotes). There is
no escape character (like `\'`) within raw strings.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Simplicity**: Users have a simple mental model: Single quotes are literal, double quotes are interpreted.
- **Template Friendly**: Defining Mustache or other `{{ }}` based templates is trivial.
- **Solves Nested Quote Issues**: Users can now use interpreted strings inside interpolation blocks without collision by
  using single quotes for internal keys, e.g., `"{{map['key']}}"`.

### Negative

- **No Escaping**: If a string contains both `'` and `'''`, it cannot be represented in a raw string without
  modification.

### Neutral

- **Consistent Delimiters**: Follows the pattern of languages like Python or Ruby where quote type signifies behavior,
  but adopts stricter raw content rules.
