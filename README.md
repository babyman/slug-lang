Slug
===

A small, opinionated programming language.

A Word of Warning
===
"Perfect is the enemy of good."
---

```
Slug will never end,
but still I write and mend.
Perfect waits and fades â€”
good enough, again.
```

Slug is a work in progress, and may never reach a stable release. However I am using it for all of my personal projects
in an effort to keep it alive and useful.
